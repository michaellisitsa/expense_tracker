<h2>How to use?</h2>
<p>
  This website allows you to create categories of expenses, and then submit your
  expenses over some periods of time (which can be with gaps).<br />
  Then the website will work out how much you have spent (averaging over any
  missing periods) in the last week / month / year.
</p>
<ol class="instructionList">
  <li>
    Add some new expenditure categories, and an approximate budget you have for
    each.
  </li>
  <li>Click into the category you are interested in.</li>
  <li>
    Create a new time expense period. This is sort of like an order, which will
    have one or more individual items inside it.
  </li>
  <li>
    You'll be directed to a list where you can add as many individual expense
    items under the time period.
  </li>
  <li>
    The top banner will always show an average of you expenditure for the last
    week / month / year, as well as what you budgetted.
  </li>
</ol>

Happy budgetting! {%else%}
